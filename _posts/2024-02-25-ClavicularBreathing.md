# **Clavicular Breathing: A Guide to Expanding Your Awareness**

## **What is Clavicular Breathing?**

Clavicular breathing is a type of breathing that focuses on expanding the upper lungs. It's often used in combination with thoracic breathing, especially during periods of great stress or when there are obstructive airway problems, such as asthma or emphysema.

### Benefits of Clavicular Breathing:

- Can be helpful in certain situations, such as when we need to take a quick, shallow breath, or when we are singing or playing a wind instrument.
- Can help to improve vocal projection.
- Can help to reduce stress and anxiety.

### How to Practice Clavicular Breathing:

1. Start by practicing thoracic breathing for a few minutes.
2. Once you're comfortable with thoracic breathing, inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your chest to expand. 
3. Continue inhaling, feeling the expansion move into your upper lungs (without moving the shoulders).
4. Hold your breath for a few seconds.
5. Exhale slowly through your mouth, first relaxing your neck and upper chest, and then your ribcage.
6. Continue breathing deeply for 5-10 minutes.

### Tips:

- If you feel any discomfort in your neck or shoulders, stop practicing clavicular breathing.
- Clavicular breathing is not as efficient as abdominal or thoracic breathing, so it's best to use it sparingly.

### Why Clavicular Breathing is Important:

Clavicular breathing can be helpful in certain situations, such as when we need to take a quick, shallow breath, or when we are singing or playing a wind instrument. It can also help to improve vocal projection and reduce stress and anxiety.

However, it's important to note that clavicular breathing is not as efficient as abdominal or thoracic breathing. It uses the smallest part of the lungs, and it can lead to tension in the neck and shoulders.

Therefore, it's best to use clavicular breathing sparingly, and to focus on abdominal and thoracic breathing for most of our daily breathing needs.

### In Summary:

Clavicular breathing is a type of breathing that can be helpful in certain situations. It can help to improve vocal projection, reduce stress and anxiety, and take quick, shallow breaths. However, it's not as efficient as abdominal or thoracic breathing, so it's best to use it sparingly.
