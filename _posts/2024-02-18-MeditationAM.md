## Meditation: A Journey of Inner Peace and Self-Discovery

During menstruation, your sensitivity and awareness are heightened, making it an ideal time for meditation. Here's a simple and insightful guide to help you embark on this journey:

**Antar Mouna: The Practice of Inner Silence**

Antar mouna is a powerful meditation technique that involves observing your thoughts without judgment or suppression. It helps you release mental tension, confront fears, and achieve a state of inner peace.

**Six Stages of Antar Mouna:**

1. **Awareness of Sense Perceptions:** Notice the sensations in your body and the sounds around you. Be present and fully aware, without analyzing or judging.

2. **Awareness of Spontaneous Thought Processes:** Allow thoughts to arise naturally and observe them as if they were passing clouds. Don't try to control or censor them.

3. **Conscious Creation of Thoughts:** Choose a particular thought and explore it thoroughly. Notice all the associated thoughts and emotions without getting lost in them.

4. **Awareness and Disposal of Spontaneous Thoughts:** Allow thoughts to come and go, but don't dwell on them. If a thought persists, reflect on it briefly and then let it go.

5. **Thoughtlessness:** Aim for a state of no thoughts or visions. If a thought arises, reject it immediately and return to a state of emptiness.

6. **Psychic Symbol Awareness:** Create an image of your personal psychic symbol, such as a deity, mantra, or flower. Focus on this symbol to deepen your meditation and reach a higher state of awareness.

**Tips for Practice:**

- Start with short sessions and gradually increase the duration.
- Sit in a comfortable position with your spine erect.
- Close your eyes to reduce distractions.
- Be patient and persistent. It takes time to develop the skill of inner silence.
- Don't be discouraged if your mind wanders. Simply bring your attention back to the present moment.

By practicing antar mouna, you can unlock the transformative power of meditation. It will help you cultivate inner peace, enhance your self-awareness, and connect with your true nature.
