# Discover the Transformative Power of Vaman Dhouti: A Journey to Inner Cleanliness

Imagine a gentle yet powerful way to cleanse your stomach and lungs, leaving you feeling refreshed, revitalized, and free from impurities. Vaman Dhouti, an ancient Ayurvedic practice, offers just that!

## How to Practice Vaman Dhouti:

1. **Preparation:** Prepare warm salted water (2 teaspoons salt per liter) and set aside about 2 liters. Find a comfortable squatting or seated position.
2. **Drinking:** Begin drinking the water steadily, neither too slowly nor too quickly. Aim to consume 6-8 glasses for effective cleansing. As your stomach fills, you may feel some nausea. Take deep breaths and continue drinking.
3. **Expulsion:** Once your stomach is full, stand up and gently press two fingers on the back of your tongue. This will trigger the expulsion of water. Continue pressing until no more water comes out.
4. **Rest:** Lie down in Shavasana (Corpse Pose) for 10 minutes to allow your body to rest and absorb the benefits. You can eat after 30 minutes.
