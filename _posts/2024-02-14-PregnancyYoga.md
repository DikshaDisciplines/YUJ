## Pregnancy Yoga: A Journey of Care and Connection

### Guidelines for a Safe and Nurturing Practice:

- **Protect your belly:** Avoid any poses that compress or overstretch your abdomen.

- **Prioritize your baby's well-being:** Always practice with your baby's safety in mind.

- **Be gentle and respectful:** Pregnancy is a time for self-care and love. Avoid pushing your limits.

- **Create space and openness:** Choose poses that help you feel relaxed and spacious.

- **Listen to your body:** If a pose feels uncomfortable, release it immediately.

- **Overstretching:** Be mindful of overstretching due to increased relaxin levels.

- **Gentle twists:** Avoid strong twists. Instead, opt for gentle open twists.

- **Avoid abdominal contractions:** Protect your core by avoiding exercises that engage your abdominal muscles.

- **Backbends:** Practice gentle backbends only. As your pregnancy progresses, be extra cautious.

- **Pelvic area:** Avoid any strain to your pelvic area, especially during the first trimester.

- **Prone positions:** Avoid lying on your stomach from the second trimester.

- **Lying on your back:** If lying on your back feels uncomfortable or causes dizziness, avoid it from the second trimester.

- **Inversions:** Avoid inversions due to possible pressure on your blood vessels and dizziness.

- **Holding poses:** Avoid holding poses for extended periods. Take breaks and move around to prevent blood flow issues.

- **Trust your instincts:** If a pose doesn't feel right, stop it.
