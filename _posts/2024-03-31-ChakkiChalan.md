# ChakkiChalan: The Mill Grinding Pose for Core Strength, Hip Flexibility, and Pelvic Health

ChakkiChalan is a dynamic yoga pose that strengthens the lower back and abdominal muscles, creates space in the pelvic region, opens the hips, and stretches the inner thighs and legs.

**How to Practice ChakkiChalan:**

1. Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you, as far apart as is comfortable.
2. Interlace your fingers in front of your chest with your arms straight.
3. Inhale and exhale, bending forward as far as is comfortable.
4. Slowly bend towards your right foot, then inhale and bring your body back to the center.
5. As you exhale, continue moving towards your left foot, then inhale and return to the center.
6. Continue the circular movement with your breath, making one rotation with each breath.
7. Make the circle as large as you feel comfortable with.
8. Try to keep your chest open and avoid bending your back.
9. Your arms should remain straight and your legs should remain fixed and stable on the mat.
10. Practice a few rounds in the opposite direction.
