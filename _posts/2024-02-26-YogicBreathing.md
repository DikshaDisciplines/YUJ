# Yogic Breathing: A Guide to Maximum Inhalation and Exhalation

Yogic breathing is a type of breathing that involves the use of the abdomen, chest, and clavicular region. It's a powerful breathing technique that can help to improve our overall health and well-being.

### Benefits of Yogic Breathing:

- Increases lung capacity
- Improves oxygenation of the blood
- Reduces stress and anxiety
- Promotes relaxation
- Helps to detoxify the body
- Boosts energy levels
- Improves digestion
- Strengthens the immune system

### Here are some additional insights of yogic breathing:

- Can help to improve sleep: Yogic breathing can help to reduce stress and anxiety, which can lead to improved sleep. It can also help to relax the body and mind, making it easier to fall asleep.
- Can help to reduce pain: Yogic breathing can help to reduce pain by releasing endorphins, which have pain-relieving effects. It can also help to relax the muscles and reduce tension, which can further reduce pain levels.
- Can help to improve cognitive function: Yogic breathing can help to improve cognitive function by increasing oxygen flow to the brain. This can lead to improved memory, concentration, and decision-making abilities.
- Can help to improve athletic performance: Yogic breathing can help to improve athletic performance by increasing lung capacity and oxygen intake. This can lead to increased endurance and energy levels.

### How to Practice Yogic Breathing:

1. Sit or lie down in a comfortable position.
2. Place one hand on your abdomen and the other on your chest.
3. Inhale slowly through your nose, allowing your abdomen to expand.
4. When your abdomen has expanded as much as it can, allow your chest to expand outward and upward.
5. Once your ribs have expanded as much as they can, inhale a little more so that your collar bones move up slightly.
6. Then slowly exhale through your mouth, first allowing your collar bones to move downward, then your chest, and finally your abdomen.
7. Continue the practice without any strain, jerks, or tension. The breath should feel natural and after some time it should be mostly thoracic and abdominal breathing. Abdominal breathing should be at least 70% of the breath.

### Tips:

- If you feel any discomfort, stop practicing yogic breathing.
- Start with a few minutes of yogic breathing each day and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable.
- Yogic breathing can be combined with deep breathing (using a ratio). For example, you can inhale for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 2, and exhale for a count of 6.

### Why Yogic Breathing is Important:

Yogic breathing is an important practice for overall health and well-being. It can help to improve our lung function, oxygenate our blood, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote relaxation. It can also help to detoxify the body, boost energy levels, improve digestion, and strengthen the immune system.

By practicing yogic breathing regularly, we can reap a wide range of benefits for our physical and mental health.
