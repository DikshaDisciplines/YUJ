# Thoracic Breathing: Expanding Your Awareness

Thoracic breathing is a simple yet powerful practice that can have a profound impact on our health and well-being. By taking a few minutes each day to focus on our breath, we can reap a wide range of benefits, both physically and mentally. This is a type of breathing that focuses on expanding the ribcage. It's a great way to create awareness of how we breathe and to learn the basics of yogic breathing.

### **Benefits of Thoracic Breathing:**

- **Increases lung capacity:** Thoracic breathing helps to expand the ribcage and strengthen the intercostal muscles, which can lead to increased lung capacity. This can be beneficial for people with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and COPD.
- **Improves posture:** Thoracic breathing helps to strengthen the muscles that support the spine, which can lead to improved posture. Good posture can help to reduce back pain, neck pain, and headaches.
- **Reduces stress and anxiety:** Thoracic breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for our "rest and digest" response. This can help to reduce stress and anxiety levels, and promote a sense of calm and relaxation.
- **Enhances vocal projection:** Thoracic breathing helps to strengthen the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles, which can lead to improved vocal projection. This can be beneficial for singers, actors, and public speakers.

### **How to Practice Thoracic Breathing:**

1. Sit or lie in a comfortable position.
2. Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly.
3. Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your chest to expand.
4. Exhale slowly through your mouth, feeling your chest contract.
5. Continue breathing deeply, focusing on expanding and contracting your chest.

### **Tips:**

- If your belly is moving more than your chest, you're not using your thoracic muscles properly.
- Practice thoracic breathing for a few minutes each day to improve your breathing habits.
- Make thoracic breathing a part of your daily routine, even when you're not doing yoga.

### **Why Thoracic Breathing is Important:**

Many of us breathe thoracically without even realizing it. This type of breathing is less efficient than abdominal breathing, and it can lead to a number of health problems, including stress, anxiety, and poor posture. Thoracic breathing helps to correct this by using the upper lobes of the lungs, which are more efficient at absorbing oxygen. It also helps to strengthen the intercostal muscles, which are responsible for expanding and contracting the ribcage.

You can practice this exercise for as long as you like, and as often as you like. Even a few minutes of thoracic breathing each day can make a big difference to your health and well-being. So start practicing thoracic breathing today and experience the difference for yourself!
