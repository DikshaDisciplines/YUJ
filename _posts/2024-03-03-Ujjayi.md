# Ujjayi Breath: The Victorious Breath for Inner Peace and Well-being

## Introduction:

Ujjayi breath, also known as the victorious breath, is a powerful breathing technique that harnesses the power of sound to calm the mind, reduce stress, and promote overall well-being.

## How to Practice Ujjayi Breath:

1. Focus your attention on your throat.
2. Imagine that you are breathing in and out through your throat.
3. Gently contract your throat muscles as you inhale and exhale.

5. Focus on the sound of your breath, which should resemble a soft baby's snore.
